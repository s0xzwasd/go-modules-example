# Modules

Its time to learn [go-modules! :fire:](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules)

## TL;DR (really read it all plz)

> ### Conclusion
>Go modules are the future of dependency management in Go. Module functionality is now available in all supported Go versions (that is, in Go 1.11 and Go 1.12).
>This post introduced these workflows using Go modules:
> - go mod init creates a new module, initializing the go.mod file that describes it.
> - go build, go test, and other package-building commands add new dependencies to go.mod as needed.
> - go list -m all prints the current moduleâ€™s dependencies.
> - go get changes the required version of a dependency (or adds a new dependency).
> - go mod tidy removes unused dependencies.
>
>We encourage you to start using modules in your local development and to add go.mod and > - go.sum files to your projects. To provide feedback and help shape the future of dependency management in Go, please send us bug reports or experience reports.
